# Image Processing to find the brightest spot in Astronomical images using Kadane's Algorithm
 Using Kadane's Algorithm to find the brightest spot in Astronomical images.

The maximum subarray problem is used to identify the subarray of a two dimensional array, where the sum of
elements is maximized. In terms of image processing, the solution has been used to find the brightest region
within an image.
